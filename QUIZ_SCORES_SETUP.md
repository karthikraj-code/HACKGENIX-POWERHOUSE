# Quiz Scores Database Setup

## Issue: Quiz scores not being saved

If you're only seeing GET requests but no quiz scores are being saved, the issue is likely that the `quiz_scores` table doesn't exist in your Supabase database.

## Solution: Run this SQL code

Copy and paste this SQL code into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it:

```sql
-- Create quiz_scores table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quiz_scores (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  quiz_content TEXT NOT NULL,
  total_questions INTEGER NOT NULL,
  correct_answers INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  quiz_topic TEXT,
  time_taken_seconds INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add quiz analytics columns to user_analytics table (if they don't exist)
ALTER TABLE user_analytics 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS total_quiz_sessions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS average_quiz_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS best_quiz_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quiz_scores_user_id ON quiz_scores(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quiz_scores_created_at ON quiz_scores(created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_quiz_scores_score_percentage ON quiz_scores(score_percentage);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE quiz_scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create RLS policies for quiz_scores
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores;
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own quiz scores" ON quiz_scores
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create function to update user analytics when quiz score is inserted
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_user_quiz_analytics()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Update user analytics with new quiz data
  INSERT INTO user_analytics (
    user_id,
    total_quiz_sessions,
    average_quiz_score,
    best_quiz_score
  )
  VALUES (
    NEW.user_id,
    1,
    NEW.score_percentage,
    NEW.score_percentage
  )
  ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET
    total_quiz_sessions = user_analytics.total_quiz_sessions + 1,
    average_quiz_score = (
      (user_analytics.average_quiz_score * user_analytics.total_quiz_sessions + NEW.score_percentage) 
      / (user_analytics.total_quiz_sessions + 1)
    ),
    best_quiz_score = GREATEST(user_analytics.best_quiz_score, NEW.score_percentage),
    updated_at = NOW();
  
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

-- Create trigger to automatically update user analytics
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_user_quiz_analytics_trigger ON quiz_scores;
CREATE TRIGGER update_user_quiz_analytics_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON quiz_scores
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_quiz_analytics();
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Run the SQL code above** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Go to your Profile page** and click "Test Database Connection" in the debug component
3. **Check the browser console** for detailed logs when taking a quiz
4. **Take a quiz** and watch the console for save attempts
5. **Check your Supabase dashboard** to see if quiz_scores are being inserted

## Debug Information

The debug component will show you:
- ‚úÖ If user is authenticated
- ‚úÖ If the quiz_scores table exists
- ‚úÖ If you can insert/read from the table
- ‚ùå Any error messages

## Common Issues

1. **Table doesn't exist**: Run the SQL code above
2. **RLS policies**: Make sure RLS policies are created
3. **User not authenticated**: Make sure you're logged in
4. **Permission issues**: Check if your user has the right permissions

## Console Logs to Watch

When taking a quiz, you should see these logs in the browser console:
- üîÑ Starting to save quiz score...
- ‚úÖ User authenticated: [user-id]
- üìä Quiz data to save: [quiz-data]
- ‚úÖ Quiz score saved successfully

If you see any ‚ùå errors, that will tell us what's wrong!
